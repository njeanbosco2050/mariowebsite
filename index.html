                <p> Do not waste the reader precious time. Long letters are a turn off.
                    Make your letter come Alive - Try to address the letter directly to the reader. Visualize the reader ahead of you & and imagine yourself talking with him through your letter. Anyone would like to read a pleasant letter when it appears specially written for him.
                    
                    Make it CORRECT - Avoid spelling, poor grammar, and mistakes in your letter. If you can prepare your letter on a computer, it will be neater.
                    
                    In a few words, Be clear about what you want to write in your letter and the reason why you want to write it to this particular recipient. This may avoid confusion and provide clarity to the reader. 
                    Ensure that you write the letter clearly and choose words which are up to the point. Make it a point that the reader can comprehend the subject matter and try to use simple words as much as possible. Use technical and complicated words only if the situation demands it.
                    
                    The letter needs to be written in a readable style. Emphasize your points and present the matter as directly as possible so that the letter commands attention from the reader. Avoid using monotonous sentences, as it will lead to the reader losing interest in your letter. 
                    To conclude, a well written letter contributes to the success of the sender as he/she expresses his/her views clearly.
                    Even though we distinguished two types of letters, we will only limit ourselves to formal letters because they are the most critical ones. In our academic environment as well as in society, we spend much time writing formal letters depending on the situation that compels us to do so. Therefore, much time will be spent on acquiring skills on how to write different types of formal letters.
